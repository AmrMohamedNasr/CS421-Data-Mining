# CS421 : Data Mining Labs
---
## Lab 1
* Exploration and Visualization of the Iris dataset.
---
## Lab 2
* Exploration of the [segmentation dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/image/).
* Visualization of the dataset with multiple plots like person, correlation coefficient and histograms.
* Apply different preprocessing techniques(normalization with min-max or z-score and dimensionality reduction using feature projection or selection) and visualizing their effects.

## Lab 3
* Exploration of the [MAGIC gamma telescope dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/MAGIC+Gamma+Telescope).
* Visualization of the dataset.
* Balancing the dataset.
* Splitting the dataset to training and testing data.
* Preprocessing the dataset.
* Applying different classification techniques : descision trees, Adaboost, K-Nearest neighbours, random forests, support vector machines and naive-bayes.
* Tuning different models for better performance.
* Analyzing and comparison of the different models.
